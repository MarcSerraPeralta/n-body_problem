# Example of simulation

## Solar system

The following example of simulation is the evolution of some planets and asteroids of the solar system from 2019/01/01 to 2044/01/01 (a period of 25 years). The considered bodies are:

- Sun
- Venus
- Earth
- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Moon
- Apollo

Other planets can be also considered but in order to determine the trajectory of the asteriod Apollo only the bodies with higher mass or closest to it have been used. It has to be taken into account that Mercury cannot be used in this simulation as there are relativistic effects due to its proximity to the Sun. 
As the mass of Apollo has not been determined, the mass of Eros has been used as asteroids have the same order of magnitude in mass (this approximation is correct as the asteroid's mass is despicable from the other bodies).
